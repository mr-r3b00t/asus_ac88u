The Network Services filter blocks the LAN to WAN packet exchanges and restricts devices from using specific network services.<p>For example, if you do not want the device to use the Internet service, key in 80 in the destination port. The traffic that uses port 80 will be blocked (but https can not be blocked).<p>Leave the source IP field blank to apply this rule to all LAN devices.
Enable the firewall to protect your local area network against attacks from hackers. The firewall filters the incoming and outgoing packets based on the filter rules.
<b>Black List Duration :</b> During the scheduled duration, clients in the Black List cannot use the specified network services. After the specified duration, all the clients in LAN can access the specified network services.<br><b>White List Duration :</b> During the scheduled duration, clients in the White List can ONLY use the specified network services. After the specified duration, clients in the White List and other network clients will not be able to access the Internet or any Internet service.
<b>NOTE :</b> If you set the subnet for the White List, IP addresses outside the subnet will not be able to access the Internet or any Internet service.
MAC filter allows you to accept or deny network access for devices with specific MAC addresses.<p>You can set the MAC filter to the Accept or Reject mode.<p>In the Reject mode, devices in the list are denied access to the network.<p>In the Accept mode, only the devices that are in the list can access the network. The devices that are not in the list are denied access to the network.
A \"denial-of-service\" attack is an explicit attempt to deny legitimate users from using a service or computer resource.<p>Enabling this feature can protect the router from DoS attack but it would increase the router's workload.

NAT (Network Address Translation) is a process used in routers to replace the address information of network packet with new address information. Typical applications for NAT is router which connect to LAN with the WAN. In LAN every network devices had a private IP(LAN IP) but there is only one public IP(WAN IP). To grant the network devices access to the Internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the sender with its own public IP address in all outgoing data packets. The router saves all necessary information in a table(NAT table) so that incoming data packets can then be assigned on the correct network device.

Port range accepts various formats such as Port Range (300:350), individual ports (566,789) or Mix (1015:1024,3021)
Port Trigger allows you to temporarily open data ports when LAN devices require unrestricted access to the Internet. There are two methods for opening incoming data ports: port forwarding and port trigger. Port forwarding opens the specified data ports all the time and devices must use static IP addresses. Port trigger only opens the incoming port when a LAN device requests access to the trigger port. Unlike port forwarding, port trigger does not require static IP addresses for LAN devices. Port forwarding allows multiple devices to share a single open port and port trigger only allows one client at a time to access the open port.

From the User-defined QoS rules dropdown list, you can prioritize the network applications or devices into five levels. Based on priority level, QoS uses the following methods in sending data packets:<ul><li>Change the order of upstream network packets, which refer to the order in which packets are sent to the Internet.</li><li>Low-priority packets are disregarded to ensure the transmission of high-priority packets. The higher priority upstream packet will cause the higher priority downstream packet.</li><li>If there are no packets being sent from high-priority applications, the full transmission rate of the Internet connection is available for low-priority packets.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Enable QoS then set up the upload and download rate limits.</li></ul>
Transferred
In the 'Transferred column', set the network traffic limit (in KB) for a specific service to generate specific priorities for the service assigned to a specific port. For example, if two network clients, PC 1 and PC 2, are both accessing the Internet (set at port 80), but PC 1 exceeded the network traffic limit due to some downloading tasks, PC 1 will be given a lower priority. The Transferred column refers to the upstream and downstream traffic (outgoing and incoming network traffic) for one session. If you do not want to set the traffic limit, you can leave it blank.
Enable QoS then set up the user-defined rules.
By default, the priority for upload and download bandwidth is "low". If there is no bandwidth priority rule, the priority for both upload and download bandwidth is "low".

ASUS RT-AC88U Router supports tag-based VLAN network that allows you to classify the LAN network for different client device groups. To isolate the devices from each other, you also need to co-locate with different subnets for each VLAN. If the VLAN is enabled, the untagged packet received from each Ethernet interface will be forwarded based on the PVID value configured on the table below.

Multiple VPN Connection
allows you to connect to multiple VPN servers simultaneously and assign your client devices to connect to different VPN tunnels. Some devices like set-top boxes, smart TVs and Blu-ray players do not support VPN software. This feature provides VPN access to such devices in a home network without having to install VPN software, while your smartphone remains connected to Internet not VPN.
For Gamer, VPN connection counteracts DDoS attacks to prevent your PC game or your stream from disconnecting with game servers. Building a VPN connection also can simply change your IP address to the region where the game server is located, to improve your ping to game servers.
To start, please follow the steps below:
Click the "+" button beside Server List to add a new VPN tunnel.
Activate the VPN connection you created in Server List.
Click the "+" button beside Exception List and select the online client you want to configure.
