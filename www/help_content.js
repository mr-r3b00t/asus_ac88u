However if your VDSL connection is unstable or not able to establish a connection, for this case then set to a higher value such as 9dB ~ 30dB.",

DSLAM could use UPBO to reduce the Tx Power of your xDSL modem router, in some cases abnormal UPBO control from DSLAM could leads to sync up issue(such as not enough Tx Power to sync with minimum rate). Thus with this feature now you could disable UPBO and will not get affected by DSLAM setting.",
